`SimplyCoreAudio` (formerly known as `AMCoreAudio`) is a Swift framework that aims to make [Core Audio](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudio) use less tedious in macOS.

### Features

- Enumerating audio devices (see [SimplyCoreAudio](https://rnine.github.io/SimplyCoreAudio/Classes/SimplyCoreAudio.html))
- Getting/setting default input, output and system device (see [SimplyCoreAudio](https://rnine.github.io/SimplyCoreAudio/Classes/SimplyCoreAudio.html))
- Creating and destroying aggregate devices (see [SimplyCoreAudio](https://rnine.github.io/SimplyCoreAudio/Classes/SimplyCoreAudio.html))
- Querying audio device properties such as: name, manufacturer, UID, volume, mute, sample rate, clock source, etc. (see [AudioDevice](https://rnine.github.io/SimplyCoreAudio/Classes/AudioDevice.html))
- Managing (physical and virtual) audio streams associated to an audio device (see [AudioStream](https://rnine.github.io/SimplyCoreAudio/Classes/AudioStream.html))
- Subscribing to audio hardware, audio device, and audio stream notifications (see [Notification Extensions](https://rnine.github.io/SimplyCoreAudio/Extensions/Notification/Name.html))

### Resources

- [API Reference](https://rnine.github.io/SimplyCoreAudio)
- [Core Audio](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudio)
- [HALLab (distributed as part of the Additional Tools for Xcode package)](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)

### Requirements

- Xcode 12+
- Swift 4.0+
- macOS 10.12+

### Installation

To install the Swift Package, please follow the steps below:

- Add `https://github.com/rnine/SimplyCoreAudio.git` as a [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) dependency to your project.
- When asked to **Choose Package Options**, use the default settings provided by Xcode.
- When asked to **Add Package**, add `SimplyCoreAudio` to your desired target(s).

### Usage

1. Import `SimplyCoreAudio`
    ```swift
    import SimplyCoreAudio
    ```

2. Instantiate `SimplyCoreAudio`
    ```swift
    let simplyCA = SimplyCoreAudio()
    ```

3. Interact with `SimplyCoreAudio`
    ```swift
    // Get the default output device
    let device = simplyCA.defaultOutputDevice
    
    // Get all output devices
    simplyCA.allOutputDevices
    
    // You can also filter devices by the scope needed
    simplyCA.allDevices.filter { $0.channels(scope: .output) > 0 }

    // For example, list all devices that aren't aggregate ones that support input 
    simplyCA.allNonAggregateDevices.filter { $0.channels(scope: .input) > 0 }

    // After you've chosen a device you can set it as the default.
    // This will switch the selected device in the system
    device.isDefaultOutputDevice = true

    // Set the default input device to a new device
    device.isDefaultInputDevice = true

    // Get preferred output channels
    if let stereoPair = device.preferredChannelsForStereo(scope: .output) {
        let leftChannel = stereoPair.left
        let rightChannel = stereoPair.right
        // Use channels...
    }

    // Get device samplerate
    if let sampleRate = device.nominalSampleRate {
        // Use samplerate...
    }

    // Get device virtual main volume
    if let outVolume = device.virtualMainVolume(scope: .output) {
        // Use output volume...
    }
    ```

4. Subscribe to hardware-related notifications
    ```swift
    // e.g., subscribing to `deviceListChanged` notification.
    var observer = NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: .deviceListChanged,
                                                           object: nil,
                                                            queue: .main) { (notification) in
        // Get added devices.
        guard let addedDevices = notification.userInfo?["addedDevices"] as? [AudioDevice] else { return }

        // Get removed devices.
        guard let removedDevices = notification.userInfo?["removedDevices"] as? [AudioDevice] else { return }
    }

    // Once done observing, remove observer and nil it.
    NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(observer)
    observer = nil
    ```

5. Subscribe to notifications from a specific audio device
    ```swift
    // Get the default output device
    let device = simplyCA.defaultOutputDevice

    // e.g., subscribing to `deviceNominalSampleRateDidChange` notification.
    var observer = NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: .deviceNominalSampleRateDidChange,
                                                           object: device,
                                                            queue: .main) { (notification) in
        // Handle notification.
    }

    // Once done observing, remove observer and nil it.
    NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(observer)
    observer = nil
    ```

6. Subscribe to notifications from a specific audio stream
    ```swift
    // Get the default output device
    let device = simplyCA.defaultOutputDevice

    // Get the first output stream
    guard let streams = device.streams(scope: .output) else { return }
    guard let stream0 = streams.first else { return }

    // e.g., subscribing to `streamPhysicalFormatDidChange` notification.
    var observer = NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: .streamPhysicalFormatDidChange,
                                                           object: stream0,
                                                            queue: .main) { (notification) in
        // Handle notification.
    }

    // Once done observing, remove observer and nil it.
    NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(observer)
    observer = nil
    ```
